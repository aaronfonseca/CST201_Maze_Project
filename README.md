# CST201 CLC - Maze Project 1

## Aaron Fonseca

Write your code in the language specified by your instructor.
The input to your program should be screen based or from a file, as directed by your instructor.
The output of your program should appear on screen and/or in a file, as directed by your instructor.
There are always multiple ways to code a project. In class, we will discuss several options. It is up to you to choose the implementation you prefer. Your code must perform all the required tasks and all other requirements in this document must be met.
Your code must be fully commented, but focus on the main programming blocks.
Include a screenshot of the running program.
When an error in reading data is detected, your program should alert the user in a helpful manner (think of it as customer service to the user).
Submit the following:

## By Day 5 of the week assigned: a summary of the main purpose of your project, a detailed description of your implementation approach, and a code skeleton (i.e., class with stubs for all methods)

## By the assignment due date: complete running program, commented code, the input file, and the entire code project as one zipped file. Include a ReadMe file with instruction on how to run it and what software is required.
This assignment uses a grading rubric. Instructors will be using the rubric to grade the assignment; therefore, students should review the rubric prior to beginning the assignment to become familiar with the assignment criteria and expectations for successful completion of the assignment.
